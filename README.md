# Taking the refuge out of refugee

An ongoing exploratory data analysis of the transient homeless population in and out of Toronto's shelter system, and the intersection of homelessness and the current migrant crisis. The full case study and updates are available [on my website](https://www.emilyxing.com/projects/toronto-shelter-system-2017). 

## Summary

Using the [Daily Shelter Occupancy](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#711ba031-b32b-3390-ce54-22c15ac6389f) dataset from 2017 - current, I explored trends in occupancy and capacity rates of 56 different homeless shelters in Toronto. From my analysis, I deduced that not only has occupancy been steadily increasing in the past year, but the increase in population is driven primarily by refugees and asylum claimants.

This conclusion is derived from an investigation into the demographic breakdown of the homeless population in these shelters.

Looking further into shelters within the Family sector produced some interesting results. The increase is again, not evenly distributed across shelters, but concentated within a single shelter - the COSTI Immigration Reception Centre. The COSTI centre provides services *specifically* to refugees and asylum seekers.

The results of this exploration indicate a possible connection with the current ongoing migrant crisis at the Canada-US border.
